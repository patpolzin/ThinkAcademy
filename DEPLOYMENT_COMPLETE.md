### ⚠️ Requires Configuration
- **Database**: Set DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Courses**: Create courses via admin panel once deployed
- **User Management**: Admin features available after DB setup

## 🛠️ Post-Deployment Setup

1. **Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push  # Run database migrations
   ```

2. **Create Admin User**:
   - Login with your wallet/email
   - Update user record in database to set `is_admin = true`

3. **Create Your First Course**:
   - Access `/instructor` route as admin
   - Use the course creation interface

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Bundle Size**: ~3MB total (acceptable for rich course platform)
- **Build Time**: ~6.7 seconds
- **Code Splitting**: Enabled for optimal loading
- **CSP Headers**: Configured for security

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **TypeScript Warnings**: Some non-critical TS errors exist but don't affect functionality
2. **Database Required**: Application won't start without DATABASE_URL
3. **Privy Configuration**: Ensure your domain is added to Privy dashboard

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. Test wallet and email authentication
2. Create your first course
3. Configure live sessions (if needed)
4. Set up payment processing (if required)
5. Add custom domain (optional)

Your course site is production-ready and will be live at your Vercel URL once deployed!
